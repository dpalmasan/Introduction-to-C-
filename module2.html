    <h1>Module 1: Introducing C++</h1>
    <h2>Available Data Types</h2>
    <p>C++ contains intrinsic data types to store numeric values in your application code. It's important to remember that these values are binary-based and not as flexible as their base 10 counterparts. For example, in mathematical terms of a base 10 integer, the definition is a value that is negative infinity to positive infinity whole numbers. Modern computers still cannot represent numbers these large. Take as an example the int type in the Numeric Data Types table. The range does not exceed 3 billion in either direction.</p>
    <p>Character data is used to represent non-numeric data such as letters and symbols.  Character data is actually represented as numeric information under the covers.  The standard char type is used to represent the numeric values for character data as represented by the basic character set present on a particular computer.  This is determined by the locale settings.</p>
    <p>For internationalization purposes, the wchar_t type is used which expands on the numeric values available to represent character sets from various languages found around the world.</p>
    <p>C++ supports other data types outside of the numeric or character data types.  The first one we see in the table below, is the Boolean data type called bool.  This is used to represent true or false values in an application.  In previous languages such as C, false was represented as a 0 value and true was represented as any non-zero value.</p>
    <p>C++ also has the concept of an enumeration, called an enum.  An enumeration is a set of constants stored as literal values.  They limit the choices for the type.  For example, when dealing with an int data type, you can assign any value to that data type that fits within the range of the integer type for that computer.  With an enum, you specify a limited set of literal constants that can be assigned to the type.</p> 

    <p>Consider the need to use a data type to represent days of the week.  How do you store this information in a data type?  You could use an array, but what type of data would you use?  Perhaps a string data type.  But how do you prevent someone from adding a non-valid day of the week, like moncleday, to the array?  If you create an enumeration that stores only valid values for Sunday through Saturday, you constrain the data type to those literal constants only.</p>
